	 		<h3>Who were the beatniks?</h3>

	 		<p>
				In the 1940s and 50s, a new generation of poets rebelled against the conventions of mainstream American life and writing. They became known as the Beat Poets––a name that evokes weariness, down-and-outness, the beat under a piece of music, and beatific spirituality.  At first, they organized in New York City, Los Angeles, and San Francisco. By the 1950s,poets at the heart of the movement had settled in the Bay Area, especially in neighborhoods near Beat poet and publisher Lawrence Ferlinghetti’s bookstore, City Lights.
				By the mid-1950s, the Beats helped to spearhead a cultural vanguard reacting against institutionalized American values, materialism, and conformity. On October 7, 1955, the Beats gave their first major public poetry reading, a seminal event held at Six Gallery in San Francisco. Among the five poets to perform their work was Allen Ginsberg, who first read <a href="https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/49303/howl" target="_blank">"Howl",</a> a poem in the tradition of Walt Whitman that Ginsberg described as “an emotional time bomb that would continue exploding… the military-industrial-nationalistic complex.”

	 	<h4>Why I chose these images and colors.</h4>
	 	<p>To me, one of the most interesting generations in American history. A new wave of bohemian movement that paved the way for the counter culture of the 60's. Interested and inspired by this generations outlook on life, philisophical, literary and artistic persuits, I decided to make a website dedicated to this generation.
	 	</p>
	 	<p>The images were taken in New York City's Greenwitch Village and San Francisco's North beach by photographer Burt Glin, who documented this underground movement in the late 50's and early 60's. They illustrate the typical life of a beatnik, from hanging out at coffeeshops discussing philosphy and politics to listening to jazz and reciting poetry or showcasing Art.</p>
	 	<p>These images also inspired the color pallet for the website. Based on most of the images I found on the web I found a lot of dark earth tones, especially black and white. However I felt that I needed to make the colors a little lighter and decided to go with the color pallet you see.</p>
