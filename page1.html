	 		<h3>Beatnik Party</h3>
	 		<p>
				The Beats were very much influenced by jazz music and musicians. Kerouac would emulate bebop and cool jazz, and like other Beats, wanted his poetry and prose to have a similar musical language, rhythmic feeling and flow to what he heard in modern jazz.
				Who are the jazz musicians who influenced the Beats? Charlie Parker (aka “Bird”), who reinvented jazz music, established a new harmonic system, and blew everybody’s minds with his improvisations. There is Lennie Tristano, who devised a new way of playing piano, adapting Bird’s improvisations to the piano keyboard and influencing generations of other musicians. Saxophonist Warne Marsh was part of the Tristano school, and taught generations of young horn players the new style of blowing. 
		
				Beat literature and bebop/cool jazz were both existential, outside the mainstream. It was in a way like outsider art, and the French understood it. The musicians mentioned here had lots in common with the Beat writers; they felt alienated from the mainstream music fans as well as from the racism of the day.

	 	<h4>Rate your experience learning how to utilize HTML5 and linking CSS. Did you like the assignment? How could this be easier to digest?</h4>
	 	<p>From a scale of 1 to 10, I give this learning experience a 10. What I enjoyed most from it, is seeing all the pieces we have learned so far coming together. I find myself understanding the workflow more and more with each assignment. I also find myself being more creative and learning how to search for the answer I am looking for. </p>

	 	<p>One thing comes to mind that would make this assignment easier is probably more resources on the workflow, and for updated video links to tutorials posted on the spread sheets.</p>
