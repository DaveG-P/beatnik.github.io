	 		<p>Born to die The Beat Generation, made up of writers, artists and misfits, was forged not long after the end of World War II. <br>People wanted change, the old ways and traditions were slowly being neglected and social rules of that time were put into question.<br> The Beat Generation were the ones leading the way in questioning the old rules and regulations not because they wanted to but<br> because America wanted it. The Beat Generation was a bohemian hipster like movement that got its drive and inspiration from<br> sexuality, drugs, booze, crazy people and situations and religions like Christianity, Judaism and Buddhism. <br>The Beat Generation embraced creativity untouched by culture.</p>

	 	<h4>Without using relative or absolute positioning, what is another wau to organize elements on a page?</h4>
	 	<p>Other than absolute and relative there are three ways to organize elements on a page and those are static, fixed, & sticky.
	 	<dl>
  		<dt>Static</dt>
  		<dd>- Is the default value an element will have.</dd>
  		<dt>Fixed</dt>
  		<dd>- will take the element out of the normal flow, and also position it in the same place on the screen.</dd>
  		<dt>Sticky</dt>
  		<dd>- Elements behave like relative elements but when a user scrolls the elements get taken out of the normal flow and behave like a fixed element.</dd>
